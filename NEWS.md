# sperrorest 1.0.0 (04 Oct 2016)

* add `parsperrorest`: This function lets you exexute `sperrorest` in parallel. 
- More information here - 

* add `partition.factor.cv`: This resampling method enables partitioning based 
on a given factor variable. This can be used, for example, to resample 
agricultural data that is grouped by fields, at the agricultural field level 
in order to preserve spatial autocorrelation within fields.

* add `benchmark` item to returned list of `sperrorest`, `parsperrorest` and 
`sperrorest.par` giving information about execution time, 
used cores and other system details. 

* create github repo of `sperrorest` at 
[https://github.com/pat-s/sperrorest/](https://github.com/pat-s/sperrorest/)

* change params: `err.unpooled` to `err.fold` and `err.pooled` to `err.rep`

* change order and naming of returned list for `sperrorest`, and `parsperrorest` 
  - class `sperrorestpoolederror` is now `sperrorestreperror`
  - returned `sperrorest` object is now ordered as follows: 
    1. error.rep
    2. error.fold
    3. importance
    4. benchmarks
    5. package.version

* add package NEWS

* add package vignette
