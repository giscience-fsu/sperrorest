\title{Summarize error statistics obtained by {sperrorest}}
\usage{
\method{summary}{sperroresterror}(object, level = 0, pooled = TRUE, na.rm = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{\code{sperroresterror} resp. \code{sperrorestcombinederror} error object
calculated by \link{sperrorest}}

\item{level}{Level at which errors are summarized: 0: overall; 1: repetition;
2: fold}

\item{pooled}{If \code{TRUE} (default), mean and standard deviation etc are
calculated between fold-level error estimates. If \code{FALSE}, apply first a
\link{weighted.mean} among folds before calculating mean, standard deviation etc
among repetitions. See also Details.}

\item{na.rm}{Remove \code{NA} values? See \link{mean} etc.}

\item{...}{additional arguments (currently ignored)}
}
\value{
Depending on the level of aggregation, a \code{list} or \code{data.frame} with
mean, and at level 0 also standard deviation, median and IQR of the error
measures.
}
\description{
\code{summary.sperroresterror} calculates mean, standard deviation,
median etc. of the calculated error measures at the specified level
(overall, repetition, or fold). \code{summary.sperrorestreperror} does the same
with the pooled error, at the overall or repetition level.
}
\details{
Let's use an example to explain the \code{error_rep} argument. E.g.,
assume we are using 100-repeated 10-fold cross-validation. If \code{error_rep = TRUE} (default), the mean and standard deviation calculated when
summarizing at \code{level = 0} are calculated across the error estimates
obtained for each of the \code{100*10 = 1000} folds. If \code{error_rep = FALSE},
mean and standard deviation are calculated across the \code{100} repetitions,
using the weighted average of the fold-level errors to calculate an error
value for the entire sample. This will essentially not affect the mean
value but of course the standard deviation of the error.

\code{error_rep = FALSE} is not recommended, it is mainly for testing purposes;
when the test sets are small (as in leave-one-out cross-validation, in the
extreme case), consider running \link{sperrorest} with \code{error_rep = TRUE} and
examine only the \code{error_rep} component of its result.
