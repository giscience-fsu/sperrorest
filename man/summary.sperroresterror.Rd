\title{Summarize error statistics obtained by \code{sperrorest}}
\usage{
\method{summary}{sperroresterror}(object, level = 0, pooled = TRUE,
  na.rm = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{\code{sperroresterror} resp. \code{sperrorestcombinederror} 
error object calculated by \code{\link{sperrorest}}}

\item{level}{Level at which errors are summarized: 
0: overall; 1: repetition; 2: fold}

\item{pooled}{If \code{TRUE} (default), mean and standard deviation etc are 
calculated between fold-level error estimates. If \code{FALSE}, 
apply first a \code{\link{weighted.mean}} among folds before calculating 
mean, standard deviation etc among repetitions. See also Details.}

\item{na.rm}{Remove \code{NA} values? See \code{\link{mean}} etc.}

\item{...}{additional arguments (currently ignored)}
}
\value{
Depending on the level of aggregation, a \code{list} or 
\code{data.frame} with mean, and at level 0 also standard deviation, 
median and IQR of the error measures.
}
\description{
\code{summary.sperroresterror} calculates mean, standard deviation, 
median etc. of the calculated error measures at the specified level 
(overall, repetition, or fold).
\code{summary.sperrorestreperror} does the same with the pooled error, 
at the overall or repetition level.
}
\details{
Let's use an example to explain the \code{pooled} argument. 
E.g., assume we are using 100-repeated 10-fold cross-validation. 
If \code{pooled=TRUE} (default), the mean and standard deviation calculated 
when summarizing at \code{level=0}
are calculated across the error estimates obtained for 
each of the \code{100*10 = 1000} folds.
If \code{pooled=FALSE}, mean and standard deviation are calculated across 
the \code{100} repetitions, using the weighted average of the fold-level 
errors to calculate an error value for the entire sample. 
This will essentially not affect the mean value but of course the 
standard deviation of the error. \code{pooled=FALSE} is not recommended, 
it is mainly for testing purposes; when the test sets are small 
(as in leave-one-out cross-validation, in the extreme case), 
consider running \code{\link{sperrorest}} with \code{err.rep=TRUE} and 
examine only the \code{pooled.error} component of its result.
