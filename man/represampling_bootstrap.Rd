\usage{
represampling_bootstrap(
  data,
  coords = c("x", "y"),
  nboot = nrow(data),
  repetition = 1,
  seed1 = NULL,
  oob = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{\code{data.frame} containing at least the columns specified by
\code{coords}}

\item{coords}{vector of length 2 defining the variables in \code{data} that
contain the x and y coordinates of sample locations.}

\item{nboot}{Size of bootstrap sample}

\item{repetition}{numeric vector: cross-validation repetitions to be
generated. Note that this is not the number of repetitions, but the indices
of these repetitions. E.g., use \code{repetition = c(1:100)} to obtain (the
'first') 100 repetitions, and \code{repetition = c(101:200)} to obtain a
different set of 100 repetitions.}

\item{seed1}{\code{seed1+i} is the random seed that will be used by \link{set.seed} in
repetition \code{i} (\code{i} in \code{repetition}) to initialize the random number
generator before sampling from the data set.}

\item{oob}{logical (default \code{FALSE}): if \code{TRUE}, use the out-of-bag sample as
the test sample; if \code{FALSE}, draw a second bootstrap sample of size \code{nboot}
independently to obtain a test sample.}
}
\value{
A \link{represampling} object. This is a (named) list containing
\code{length(repetition)}. \link{resampling} objects. Each of these contains only one
list with indices of \code{train}ing and \code{test} samples. Indices are row indices
for \code{data}.
}
\description{
\code{represampling_bootstrap} draws a bootstrap random sample (with
replacement) from \code{data}.
}
\examples{
data(ecuador)
# only 10 bootstrap repetitions, normally use >=100:
parti <- represampling_bootstrap(ecuador, repetition = 10)
# plot(parti, ecuador) # careful: overplotting occurs
# because some samples are included in both the training and
# the test sample (possibly even multiple times)
