\title{Overlapping spatial block bootstrap using circular blocks}
\usage{
represampling.disc.bootstrap(data, coords = c("x", "y"), nboot,
  repetition = 1, seed1 = NULL, oob = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{\code{data.frame} containing at least the columns specified 
by \code{coords}}

\item{coords}{vector of length 2 defining the variables in \code{data} that 
contain the x and y coordinates of sample locations.}

\item{nboot}{number of bootstrap samples; you may specify different values 
for the training sample (\code{nboot[1]}) and for the test sample 
(\code{nboot[2]}).}

\item{repetition}{numeric vector: cross-validation repetitions 
to be generated. Note that this is not the number of repetitions, 
but the indices of these repetitions. E.g., use \code{repetition=c(1:100)} 
to obtain (the 'first') 100 repetitions, and \code{repetition=c(101:200)} 
to obtain a different set of 100 repetitions.}

\item{seed1}{\code{seed1+i} is the random seed that will be used by 
\code{\link{set.seed}} in repetition \code{i} (\code{i} in \code{repetition}) 
to initialize the random number generator before sampling from the data set.}

\item{oob}{logical (default \code{FALSE}): if \code{TRUE}, use the out-of-bag 
sample as the test sample (the complement of the \code{nboot[1]} test set 
discs, minus the buffer area as specified in the \code{...} arguments to 
\code{\link{partition.disc}}); if \code{FALSE}, draw a second bootstrap 
sample of size \code{nboot} independently to obtain a test sample 
(sets of overlapping discs drawn with replacement).}

\item{...}{additional arguments to be passed to \code{\link{partition.disc}}; 
note that a \code{buffer} argument has not effect if \code{oob=FALSE}; 
see example below}
}
\description{
\code{represampling.disc.bootstrap} performs a spatial block bootstrap by 
resampling at the level of rectangular partitions or 'tiles' generated by 
\code{partition.tiles}.
}
\note{
Performs \code{nboot} out of \code{nrow(data)} resampling of circular 
discs. This is an \emph{overlapping} spatial block bootstrap where the 
blocks are circular.
}
\examples{
data(ecuador)
# Overlapping disc bootstrap:
parti = represampling.disc.bootstrap(ecuador, radius=200, nboot=20, oob=FALSE)
plot(parti,ecuador)
# Note that a 'buffer' argument would make no difference because boostrap 
# sets of discs are drawn independently for the training and test sample.
#
# Overlapping disc bootstrap for training sample, out-of-bag sample as test 
# sample:
parti = represampling.disc.bootstrap(ecuador, radius=200, buffer=200, 
                                     nboot=10, oob=TRUE)
plot(parti,ecuador)
