\title{Determine the names of neighbouring tiles in a rectangular pattern}
\usage{
tile.neighbors(nm, tileset, iterate = 0, diagonal = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{nm}{Character string or factor: name of a tile, e.g., \code{"X4:Y6"}}

\item{tileset}{Admissible tile names; if missing and \code{nm} is a factor 
variable, then \code{levels(nm)} is used as a default for \code{tileset}.}

\item{iterate}{internal - do not change default: to control behaviour in an 
interative call to this function.}

\item{diagonal}{if \code{TRUE}, diagonal neighbours are also considered 
neighbours.}
}
\value{
Character string.
}
\description{
This based on "counting" up and down based on the tile name.
