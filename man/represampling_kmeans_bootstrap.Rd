\usage{
represampling_kmeans_bootstrap(
  data,
  coords = c("x", "y"),
  repetition = 1,
  nfold = 10,
  nboot = nfold,
  seed1 = NULL,
  oob = FALSE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{\code{data.frame} containing at least the columns specified by
\code{coords}}

\item{coords}{vector of length 2 defining the variables in \code{data} that
contain the x and y coordinates of sample locations.}

\item{repetition}{numeric vector: cross-validation repetitions to be
generated. Note that this is not the number of repetitions, but the indices
of these repetitions. E.g., use \code{repetition = c(1:100)} to obtain (the
'first') 100 repetitions, and \code{repetition = c(101:200)} to obtain a
different set of 100 repetitions.}

\item{nfold}{see \link{partition_kmeans}}

\item{nboot}{see \link{represampling_factor_bootstrap}}

\item{seed1}{\code{seed1+i} is the random seed that will be used by \link{set.seed} in
repetition \code{i} (\code{i} in \code{repetition}) to initialize the random number
generator before sampling from the data set.}

\item{oob}{see \link{represampling_factor_bootstrap}}

\item{...}{additional arguments to be passed to \link{partition_kmeans}}
}
\description{
\code{represampling_kmeans_bootstrap} performs a non-overlapping
spatial block bootstrap by resampling at the level of irregularly-shaped
partitions generated by \link{partition_kmeans}.
