\title{Partition the data for a (non-spatial) k-fold cross-validation at the
group level}
\usage{
partition_factor_cv(
  data,
  coords = c("x", "y"),
  fac,
  nfold = 10,
  repetition = 1,
  seed1 = NULL,
  return_factor = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{\code{data.frame} containing at least the columns specified by
\code{coords}}

\item{coords}{vector of length 2 defining the variables in \code{data} that
contain the x and y coordinates of sample locations.}

\item{fac}{either the name of a variable (column) in \code{data}, or a vector of
type factor and length \code{nrow(data)} that defines groups or clusters of
observations.}

\item{nfold}{number of partitions (folds) in \code{nfold}-fold cross-validation
partitioning}

\item{repetition}{numeric vector: cross-validation repetitions to be
generated. Note that this is not the number of repetitions, but the indices
of these repetitions. E.g., use \code{repetition = c(1:100)} to obtain (the
'first') 100 repetitions, and \code{repetition = c(101:200)} to obtain a
different set of 100 repetitions.}

\item{seed1}{\code{seed1+i} is the random seed that will be used by \link{set.seed} in
repetition \code{i} (\code{i} in \code{repetition}) to initialize the random number
generator before sampling from the data set.}

\item{return_factor}{if \code{FALSE} (default), return a \link{represampling} object;
if \code{TRUE} (used internally by other {sperrorest} functions), return a
\code{list} containing factor vectors (see Value)}
}
\value{
A \link{represampling} object, see also \link{partition_cv} for details.
}
\description{
\code{partition_factor_cv} creates a \link{represampling} object, i.e. a
set of sample indices defining cross-validation test and training sets,
where partitions are obtained by resampling at the level of groups of
observations as defined by a given factor variable. This can be used, for
example, to resample agricultural data that is grouped by fields, at the
agricultural field level in order to preserve spatial autocorrelation
within fields.
}
\note{
In this partitioning approach, the number of factor levels in \code{fac}
must be large enough for this factor-level resampling to make sense.
