\title{Calculate mean nearest-neighbour distance between point datasets}
\usage{
dataset.distance(d1, d2, x.name = "x", y.name = "y", fun = mean,
  method = "euclidean", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{d1}{a \code{data.frame} with (at least) columns with names given by 
\code{x.name} and \code{y.name}; these contain the x and y coordinates, 
respectively.}

\item{d2}{see \code{d1}  - second set of points}

\item{x.name}{name of column in \code{d1} and \code{d2} containing the x 
coordinates of points.}

\item{y.name}{same for y coordinates}

\item{fun}{function to be applied to the vector of nearest-neighbor 
distances of \code{d1} from \code{d2}.}

\item{method}{type of distance metric to be used; only \code{'euclidean'} 
is currently supported.}

\item{...}{additional arguments to \code{fun}.}
}
\value{
depends on \code{fun}; typically (e.g., \code{mean}) a numeric vector
of length 1
}
\description{
\code{dataset.distance} calculates Euclidean nearest-neighbour distances 
between two point datasets and summarizes these distances using some 
function, by default the mean.
}
\details{
Nearest-neighbour distances are calculated for each point in 
\code{d1}, resulting in a vector of length \code{nrow(d1)}, and \code{fun} 
is applied to this vector.
}
\examples{
d = data.frame(x = rnorm(100), y = rnorm(100))
dataset.distance(d, d) # == 0
